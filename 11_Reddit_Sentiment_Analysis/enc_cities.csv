She was quiet and otherwise polite, even when someone grabbed her bag for her after it had to be placed in an overhead bin behind her.  Her act is just that - an act.  Doesn't make her any better of a person - just deceitful on top of everything else."
jglvdbi,raleigh,12pf6ay,0.3,"Honestly, not surprising. 

Still amazed that it works so well."
jglwgsc,raleigh,12pf6ay,0.9,"Mad respect to this guy. Tbh, I have absolutely no idea where he stands on most political issues, but anyone bringing more transparency and knowledge to the general public on the workings of Congress is doing God's work."
jgly71z,raleigh,12pf6ay,0.9,This guy seems like a sturdy individual. Clear communication without bias. We need more conversations like this
jglw3q7,raleigh,12pf6ay,0.6,"It's something we already pretty much knew but it doesn't feel any better confirming that's how some politicians act. This is why some folks say they don't follow politics(when they should) and its disheartening knowing these politicians can pretty much lie to the public and get away with it.  And this is what leads to terrible people getting reelected over and over again. Its all a farce. 

But thank you for calling it out and shining a spotlight on it. We need more politicians like you who are honest and calm in front of the public while being loud and fighting for our rights behind closed doors. At least that's what I hope you're doing."

jgms2h8,raleigh,12pf6ay,0.9,We need to protect this man at all costs. He‚Äôs so transparent that it makes me feel like he is doing something wrong.

jiul9sw,raleigh,137rg0t,-0.9,"So let me get this straight. Cotham ran as a Dem in support of womens rights to choose. Gave a speech on the House floor explaining that she had an abortion, saying, ""This decision was up to me, my husband, my doctor and my God. It was not up to any of you in this chamber."" As soon as she is elected as a democrat she switched parties to republican, giving them the super majority and now voted in favor of a BAN on abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy.

jiutfhd,raleigh,137rg0t,0.2,"Here‚Äôs the link to the actual bill, and a TL;DR I was able cobble together relative to the changes made to a women's right to choose an abortion.

[https://webservices.ncleg.gov/ViewBillDocument/2023/5440/0/S20-PCCS15344-BC-2](https://webservices.ncleg.gov/ViewBillDocument/2023/5440/0/S20-PCCS15344-BC-2)

The North Carolina General Assembly has introduced the ""Care for Women, Children, and Families Act,"" which covers a wide range of changes to healthcare laws and appropriations for healthcare programs. In addition to revising abortion laws, the legislation includes provisions to reduce infant and maternal mortality, provide parental leave for state employees, improve child permanency, facilitate safe surrender of infants, support foster care and adoption, and expand access to childcare.

The bill establishes the ""Woman's Right to Know Act,"" which requires doctors to display a real-time view of the unborn child before an abortion, and it prohibits partial-birth abortions. The legislation also includes informed consent and reporting requirements for abortions performed due to a life-limiting anomaly.

The document outlines specific time frames during which abortions can be performed based on different circumstances. During the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, a qualified physician licensed to practice medicine in a suitable facility can perform the abortion, either through surgical or medical means. After the 12th week and up to the 20th week, abortions can only be performed in cases of rape or incest. After the 20th week, abortions are only permitted if a qualified physician determines that there is a life-limiting anomaly.

The bill will take effect on a future date, with different sections of the legislation taking effect at different points in time."

You can also bet that 100% of the people in that photo, their spouses, their mistresses, and their children will all have access to abortion that they voted to deny the rest of us.

Considering that most of our state reps are pretty well off financially due to their various business interests (few of these people have real jobs - most own their own companies), it'd be a shame if someone publicized the companies they own or have a stake in.  

Just so we can vote with our wallets on days that *aren't* Election day."
jig3d3p,raleigh,134pwcs,-0.6,"Imagine politicians ego and pride controlling millions of livelihoods. Power is so insane, and money is the core issue. Government workers, especially are public SERVANTS, and should be viewed as such.

Also from Jackson's previous post it seems like those hard lines conservatives will put on a show to hold people's attention (WWE style) but will be more sensible behind closed doors. Are we to expect that same behavior here?"
jigm4w2,raleigh,134pwcs,0.2,"Jeff, serious question here. Why can‚Äôt we just pass a continuation? Why is there no fail-safe to prevent a small group from holding the entire country hostage by allowing the previous budget to be automatically extended?

Even if he‚Äôs not talking about members of his side here, he‚Äôs exposing political theatrics, which many people participate in. I‚Äôm glad he‚Äôs doing it, though. Needs to be said.

Also, cynics would say ‚ÄúIs what Jeff‚Äôs doing here political theater itself? Is he guilty of it too?‚Äù I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs necessarily the case, but some will."
jgm11sk,Charlotte,12pf1oy,0.4,"I hear this for sure, but for me it doesn't really matter if they believe it or not.  All that matters is how they vote, and the craziest things that they yell about are how their votes are.  This isn't really reassuring to me.  If anything ""the people you see who are crazy and harmful are also craven and manipulative, and smart enough to know how to calibrate their behavior but terrible enough to let it loose in public"".  That sucks.

""Do they really believe it"" to me, doesn't matter even a little bit.

All that matters is ""are they willing to use their power as a elected official to further that"", if they are, it's doesn't matter if they believe it or not.

That said, I appreciate Jeff saying all this, and it's important to know, but there isn't a real solution here unfortunately, and doubting whether the folks like MTG believe it or not only gives her more of a pass to do what she's doing, which is causing real genuine harm.

jjjxma9,asheville,13d4sgb,0.6,"So what I don't understand is with all these people saying the media is dividing is: is that REALLY your argument?  I won't pretend they've had no effect, but me LITERALLY listening to entire speeches, watching ENTIRE segments, NOT out of context, these politicians are polarizing their constitutes.  Acting like the media is automatically pandering is ignorant at best.  I can draw my own conclusions from the LITERAL WORDS AND ACTIONS these politicians and personalities are displaying.  Doesn't take a corrupt media to paint them in an ill manner.

Did the media show bias when Donald Trump bragged about grabbing women's genitalia?  I don't mean to sound like a sympathizer for the media but it really irks me when people suggest pretty much everything is divisive and serves a higher purpose to make people afraid.

I'm very aware that, generally speaking, news outlets exist for a particular reason: to sell ad revenue.  But that doesn't mean good journalism doesn't exist.  By labeling all media as corrupt, you write off investigative journalism.  I'd argue that it's not so black and white."

The billions of dollars we spend on ""research"" that is light-years higher spending than the next 3 highest military spending countries combined...  cut that mess.  And find the holes where our money has been disappearing into for years. 

Close those Tax loopholes and remove the tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires.  Reverse Citizens United.  Outlaw corporate lobbiests.  Or, frankly, all lobbiests.  Why do we bribe our politicians legally?

jig9gq9,asheville,134pzlz,0.6,"Hi Congressman! Thanks for laying it out.

It seems like Congress has given the Executive contradicting orders: they've authorized spending by passing a budget, but they've limited the debt that can be issued to pay for it. There's a good argument to be made that the debt ceiling isn't legal.

Is it under discussion for the President to instruct the Treasury to continue issuing debt to meet the spending obligations that Congress approved? And to make the Republicans go to court to defend the debt ceiling?"

I‚Äôll give another within the week.

Unless someone too quickly finds

The treasure‚Äîdid they read my mind?


So many beautiful parks in this city!

Some for the doggies (but none for the kitties).

Some for the bicycles, some for the skates

Some for the paddlers, or kids on play dates.


There‚Äôs trees, alive and surely dead. 

And where one should protect one‚Äôs head. 

Look over and under, beneath and above.

You owe it to that part of your self.

These kids are empathetic and engaged and feel things with their whole hearts. (We really only hear about the outliers who don't or won't.) As a whole, these kids are ready to get involved and start chipping away at the societal bullshit the rest of us have just been sighing at. It doesn't matter if I disagree with some of their ideas. Hell, if these kids survived the last 7 years of anti-voting fake news and STILL want to vote, I couldn't be prouder.

I never imagined that life would bring me to where I am right now. To say this experience has opened my eyes to what this life is would be the understatement of the year, and it has made me a pretty vocal advocate. That being said.

To the people saying he should go to a shelter, because they don't want to see them. Shelters usually turn away more people than they serve. This can be for a multitude of reasons. They are full, someone not passing  a background check, history of addiction or alcohol abuse, or even a minor disagreement with an attendant or volunteer. Also, shelters are far from being safe, especially for vulnerable people. I can't stay in the shelter where I live because one of the people working there thinks I'm a Muslim.

To the folks lamenting that all homeless people are drug addicts or alcoholics. It is true that many have addictions, but it certainly isn't the case for all. Not to mention the fact that there are very few options for treatment. The fact is, every single person I know out here with an addiction also carries with them some sort of unresolved and untreated trauma. Most stemming from childhood abuse. And to make matters worse, 70%+ of homeless women report being sexually abused while homeless, with many of them stuck in ongoing abuse.

Also, keep this in mind. The number one reason for women who find themselves homeless is domestic violence.

Just my two cents."

The debt ceiling isn't about deciding how to spend money, its about deciding whether to pay back the money you owe for what you already spent, just like paying your credit card bill isn't deciding how to spend money, but whether or not you follow through on your promise to pay back the credit card company, and living with the fallout to your credit if you don't.


If you're on board with cutting some wasteful spending, here is some low hanging fruit:

* $842 Billion in the ""defense"" budget, much of which goes directly to contractors like Lockheed Martin (2022 net profits $5.7 billion), Raytheon (2022 net profits $5.2 billion)

* $20 Billion in direct subsidies to Oil, Gas and Coal, much of which goes directly to the largest oil companies like Exxon (2022 net profits 55.74B, a 141% increase from 2021!), not to mention other indirect subsidies"

jg7m4ce,GreenvilleNCarolina,12lcnws,0.7,"Damn, lots of Greenville hate. It probably isn‚Äôt a good fit from reading your post but it is a great place to some people. Very affordable compared to other places in the state. It is growing and getting more amenities every year. I like it but understand why others may not."
jgapahu,GreenvilleNCarolina,12lcnws,-0.9,"RUN! I've lived in ENC my entire life. I grew up in an infinitely smaller, more rural area than Greenville, but I have never felt as out of place there as I have here. My husband and I moved here to finish college but ended up getting a deal to buy our rental that simply couldn't be refused, then COVID happened. I identify similarly to you with some added marginalization in the mix. I can't stress this to you enough... Greenville and Washington are not a good fit. College nightlife, religion, a handful of restaurants, and a couple of greenway parks are about all this place has to offer. If you would like your children to grow up around other children being raised with similar inclusive ideologies, keep searching. I'm postponing having children until we leave for this very reason.  Please do yourself a favor and look further west or just skip NC altogether."
jg61ep7,GreenvilleNCarolina,12lcnws,-0.6,"It sounds like you‚Äôd hate it in greenville tbh. It‚Äôs not somewhere i‚Äôd choose to raise a family. In fact, I moved away when I graduated bc I was pregnant and didn‚Äôt want to live there anymore. 


There is a concentrated population in a smallish geographical area, so the traffic is insane. It‚Äôs mostly all college students or working class/poverty. Downtown is almost exclusively bars & clubs"
jg65nl0,GreenvilleNCarolina,12lcnws,-0.9,"As a resident originally from Georgia who has been stuck here for 20ish years, I would not reccomend it! I've been stuck because of my husband and his reluctance to leave and complacency which has driven me mad but I digress. We're finally moving this summer.

Housing is affordable compared to those areas but it's 5+ hours from the mountains. You may be interested in the Triad region which is 2 hours from the mountains. Greensboro and Winston-Salem have LGBTQ+ friendly areas and more to do than Greenville. The jobs are also higher paying than here. Jobs in Pitt county don't pay very well and professionals are better compensated in that region and the Triangle. Housing is affordable in the Triad. 

I would definitely not recommend Greenville."
jg9j2lo,GreenvilleNCarolina,12lcnws,0.7,"Durham checks off most of what you‚Äôre looking for. G-Vegas ain‚Äôt it. Durham pros: probably the most inclusive, diverse, liberal city in the state. Nationally acclaimed restaurants, arts, things to do, family activities (check out the museum of life and science). Not the best school districts but they are improving. Not the most affordable housing either, current mass influx of folks moving here. For context I went to college in Greenville and lived there several years after, and still have lots of family there so visit often. Currently have lived in Dirham since 2019. Greenville holds a special place in my heart, but for the things you‚Äôre looking for I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôd be happy there. Similar reasons we haven‚Äôt moved back to Greenville."

I spent time with people who moved there for work at ECU, and they have families, and gave me the honest pros and cons. All things considered, I do not think it‚Äôs as terrible as people are suggesting (or we wouldn‚Äôt be moving there). I don‚Äôt love big city life, but I also don‚Äôt want life to be so rural that there aren‚Äôt bigger community events and multiple dining options. Greenville is a decent in-between and it seems property value will only increase, as it is growing. If you do move, maybe we can be friends."

All that I would add to it is that, while performative politics has sadly become the norm, millions of Americans aren't able to make that distinction, and buy into that inflammatory rhetoric as fact, even taking it as a call to arms, so they vote for the angriest and loudest voices. My question is, how do we combat that, and prevent NC (along with the rest of the country) from turning towards increasingly delusional, regressive policies. Because right now, things look pretty iffy, and the reasonable voices aren't being heard enough."
jgo0ly6,Wilmington,12pfcmi,0.9,The more this man talks the more I like him.
jglxmxl,Wilmington,12pfcmi,0.9,These posts are appreciated. Sad it has to be said though. Thank you for reaching out to the community here.
jgm3xia,Wilmington,12pfcmi,0.6,"There are 535 senators and representatives. About 12-15 are always in the news. Can't someone coordinate a 'silent majority' of congresspeople to counterbalance the attention whores? Not on political grounds, bipartisan, just to ask people, the media to stop responding to bad actors."
jgn8jgl,Wilmington,12pfcmi,-0.9,"Of course they are, because our ‚Äúpublic servants‚Äù have turned into the D.C. political version of Hollywood actors. It seems relatively simple to me. We have a one party government with two clearly defined factions whose jobs are to provide we the the people this illusion that we have any meaningful measure of control over what happens on Capital Hill‚Ä¶ we have none. (Kennedy tried to warn us, and was killed for it) It‚Äôs all an act, for which our public servants are paid handsomely while the majority of Americans are being crushed under the weight of the effects of their actions. These people are strangling the life out of this country and laughing all the way to the bank with their stolen American wealth as we all wonder how we are going to even survive each month."
jgnwe8e,Wilmington,12pfcmi,0.7,I long suspected this but it‚Äôs refreshing to hear it from someone who is actually there. Thank you Jeff.

jh3ny5g,Wilmington,12t6xy0,0.95,Man this is super cool! I see Wilmington from about 1500ft altitude all the time but this is a totally different level!

that‚Äôs Wilmington alright"
jigm3at,Wilmington,134q1xo,0.9,"I appreciate Rep Jackson for always being straight with us. We aren‚Äôt stupid (well most of us aren‚Äôt) and having someone like him give these updates to things that will impact us is so important. We won‚Äôt hear this on the news. 

Thank you Mr Jackson‚Ä¶ we need you, and preferably 534 more of you."
jiib7ci,Wilmington,134q1xo,0.7,"Interesting he‚Äôs doing the job of a the media. Feel like when I watch the news at night it should come off with this level if intellect, calming voice and letting me decide with the facts how I feel about it."
jij87ic,Wilmington,134q1xo,0.6,I want this guy to read me books.
jijzudf,Wilmington,134q1xo,0.9,He sets a good tone for what all leadership should be doing to help with transparency.
jigcomy,Wilmington,134q1xo,-0.6,"I like this guy well enough, but it seems this ""default"" issue is a perennial event, and which side you are on is determined by party politics and who is in control. And to his point, who faces re-election around the corner. 

In the end they will find some method to kick the can down the road, and then bark about how hard they fought for their voters in campaign ads."
jiiml2m,Wilmington,134q1xo,0.9,This guy is a gem
jijoaub,Wilmington,134q1xo,0.9,You‚Äôre the best!
jijxy3y,Wilmington,134q1xo,0.1,Please run for President!!!  But I‚Äôm sure he will be voted out next term.
jikmz9e,Wilmington,134q1xo,0.9,This is a government representative.... not a politician. We need people on both sides of the aisle willing to cut the shit and work together to make this country as great as we can for everyone.
jikwklp,Wilmington,134q1xo,0.9,"When a politician explains the news better than any news anchor, there's a MAJOR problem with our news sources."
jgt41cz,Wilmington,12r3ixd,0.9,I loved going there during Christmas. The huge Christmas tree over the corner door was awesome. Also loved the smell of the Pepperidge Farm section.

jgv1oaz,Wilmington,12r3ixd,-0.9,"I don't want to start a fight, but why are libraries still a thing ? And why is this one worth saving ? I'm not a fan of the current plans for it, but other than a homeless hub, who uses it ?"
jgzwubt,Wilmington,12r3ixd,0.3,Wow that cool . I knew was downtown but never saw pic of it
